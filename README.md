## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After not coding for quite a while, this project really re-familiarized me with a lot of CSS and HTML. In particuluar I really learned a lot about flexbox using this through a lot of trial and error. I aslo learned about media queries and was able to change my full-page web design to one that worked responsively.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I want to work more on using flexbox and really get it down. I also want to start working on mobile-first design.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I constantly referenced MDN while working on this project.
